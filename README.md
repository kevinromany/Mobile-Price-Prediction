# Mobile-Price-Prediction
Mobile Price Prediction uses machine learning to estimate smartphone price ranges based on features like RAM, battery, camera, storage, and connectivity, helping users and businesses make informed pricing decisions.
# Objective
The objective of the Cellphone Price Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies mobile phones into four price ranges based on their specifications. By analyzing features such as RAM, battery power, camera quality, and connectivity options, the model helps identify how hardware components influence pricing. This prediction system can assist manufacturers, retailers, and consumers in understanding product segmentation. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an efficient and reliable model that supports decision-making in the mobile market.
