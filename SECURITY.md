## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

Please report security issues directly to the maintainer via email at: **[sowmyakommepalli1@gmail.com]**.

Do not open a public GitHub issue for security reports.
